# Lab 3: The Banker's Algorithm

## Project architecture 

The project includes the following modules: 

- IO
  - TaskReader
  - TaskPrinter
- Manager
  - OptimisticManager
  - Banker
- DS
  - TaskTable (time taken; time waiting; % time waiting)

Create a data structure that stores statistics regarding each task for inter-module communications.
